# Simple File System

This is a WIP implementation of the Simple File System (SFS) as it appears [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090923015653/http://dimensionalrift.homelinux.net/combuster/vdisk/sfs.html) (there is also a copy of this page in this reposiory).

## Progress
Currently there is a roughly-tested mkfs utility.

## Future
This project is temporarily paused while I set up my website and switch my machine to run GuixSD. When I come back I will write tests for mkfs and then work on implementing required kernel modules.
