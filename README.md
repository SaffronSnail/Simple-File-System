# Simple File System

This is a WIP implementation of the Simple File System (SFS) as it appears [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20090923015653/http://dimensionalrift.homelinux.net/combuster/vdisk/sfs.html) (there is also a copy of this page in this reposiory).

# Progress
Currently there is a roughly-tested mkfs utility.

# Future
The plan is to finish writing a test suite for mkfs by November 3. By the end of November the functions that the vfs requires should be implemented. After that, improvements to the SFS will be explored.
